      Second Edition - April 2023

      description: >-
        <p>In the second edition of Germinar-t we invited the Lab of Rooted Imagination from Barcelona for a 10 day residency to create a performance for the Festival del Agua, an event for local water justice, which the Sunseed Project in Almeria hosts every year.</p><p>What came out of the residency is a play about the struggles around legitimacy to act, about positionalities in territories marked by power dynamics in which us, as performers, as activists, as people, can not be neutral, can not not take a stance, acting is a stance equally to not acting, staying is a stance, leaving another one. </p>
