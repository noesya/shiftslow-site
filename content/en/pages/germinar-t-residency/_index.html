        <p>In the second edition of Germinar-t we invited the Lab of Rooted Imagination from Barcelona for a 10 day residency to create a performance for the Festival del Agua, an event for local water justice, which the Sunseed Project in Almeria hosts every year.</p><p>Outcome of the residency is a play about our (lacking?) connections to territory and linked struggles of positionalities in territories constituted by power dynamics. </p>
